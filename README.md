# CarpusDiem
CarpusDiem is an interactive MATLAB script designed to aid carpal lameness diagnostic testing for all experience levels of equine management.
 
CarpusDiem utilizes the Shi-Tomasi Corner Detection and a minimum eigenvalue algorithm to detect trackable points from user input. Points are continuously filtered against a forward-backward error threshold to maintain validity. Valid points are used to calculate velocity, acceleration, force of movement, and final net force acting on the carpus as a gait is maintained.
